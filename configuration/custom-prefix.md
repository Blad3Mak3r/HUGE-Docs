# Setting up a custom prefix

## Restrictions

{% hint style="warning" %}
HUGE eligible prefixes are those that do not start with the following characters.

* @
* \#
* \`
* "
{% endhint %}

## Set the prefix

To establish the prefix you must enter the following command in a channel where HUGE can read you.

```text
!prefix set [new prefix]

@HUGE prefix set [new prefix]
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Remeber that when you put the command you should not enter the characters **\[ \]**.
{% endhint %}

## Reset to defaul prefix

In case you don't like your prefix or have forgotten it, you can mention HUGE instead of using the prefix.

```text
@HUGE prefix reset

/prefix reset
```

This will make the prefix for your server back to **!**.
